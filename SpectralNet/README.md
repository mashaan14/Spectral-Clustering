## Running Guide
This project is based on the original SpectralNet code which can be found on:<br/>
https://github.com/KlugerLab/SpectralNet

The file \core\pairs.py sets pairs for Siamese net using the value provided in `siam_k`. We included a new parameter called `use_mu0` that if it was set to True it will discard the value of `siam_k` and used our method in Algorithm 1 to set pairs for Siamese net.<br/>
Run the code by executing:<br/>
`python run.py --dset=cc|Agg788|Comp399`

### Files that we modified from the original SpectralNet code
- \core\pairs.py
	to implement our method
- \core\data.py
	to upload Aggregation and Compound datasets in csv
- \core\run.py
	to include Aggregation and Compound datasets

## Python Setup
This installation tutorial was prepared on insights from this blog:<br/>
